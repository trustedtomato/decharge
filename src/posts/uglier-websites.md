title: About social media addiction and my proposed medicine

I think social media addiction is an issue lot bigger than it is usually thought to be.
It separates people instead of connecting them, radicalises people's opinions,
takes away confidence from the young and what does it give in exchange?
Small, addictive amounts of dopamine. All the other benefits are incredibly small, especially when
compared to useful ways of wasting time like meditating, reading or staring the wall.

My personal frustration was, which made my mind tick into thinking that social media is an unnecessary evil,
that it was such a frequent situation that I'm doing something with my friends, like
playing a boardgame or drinking beer, and one of us pulls out their cellphone; and man,
it kills the mood so efficiently that the event of finding out that you have skin cancer could be envious.
Now it's a rule I make that if anyone dares take a look at their phone, I'm out.
Exceptions are accepted, but only if accompanied by several sentences of excusal.
Such sins shouldn't be taken lightly, as I've found that judging it very much
succeeds in keeping the elevated atmosphere.

Anyway, after I've managed to realise that social media ain't no love in the heart of the city,
I've tried to find a way to overcome my mindless feed-scrolling addiction.
Since my phone addiction could be cured by inverting the colors and switching to greyscale,
it was natural for me as a developer to make a plugin for Firefox which makes targeted websites
ugly as well. You can try it out, although I doubt anyone uses it besides me and a few of my friends,
so the interface is not well tested and is probably pretty unintuitive. I might make a tutorial in the future.

Plus, I've found an extension called [News Feed Eradicator](https://github.com/jordwest/news-feed-eradicator/),
the name of which speaks for itself, and which has proven to be extremely successful in my case.
Props to its creator, Jordan West! ❤️
